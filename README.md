# 👋 Hi, I'm Byung Hyung Kim (김병형)

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Inha University, where I lead the [Affective Artificial Intelligence (AFFCTIV) Lab](https://affctiv.ai). My research lies at the intersection of brain-computer interfaces, affective computing, and deep learning, with a particular focus on understanding and modeling human cognitive and emotional states using multimodal biosignals such as EEG, fNIRS, and facial expressions.

In our lab, we explore novel AI models that are not only effective but also emotionally and cognitively aware. Our goal is to build intelligent systems that understand humans better — both in theory and in real-world applications.

🔬 **Current Research Interests**
- Affective computing & emotion recognition  
- Brain-computer interface (BCI)  
- Geometric deep learning on Riemannian manifolds  
- Generative models for neural decoding  
- Multimodal signal fusion and robust representation learning
